# Blackjack
Blackjack is a card game. It uses a single standard 52-card deck. This deck has:
* "number cards" with a face value of 2-10, worth the number on the card
* "face cards" (King, Queen, Jack), each worth 10 points
* "aces" (Ace), worth 1 or 11 points


# Definitions
Hand: a collection of cards that a player owns for the duration of the game.
Hit: add another card to a player's hand
Stand: add no more cards to a player's hand; stop playing a turn; proceed to the next phase of the game.
Bust: more than 21 points in a player's hand; the player's turn is instantly over; the player has lost.


# Winning
Each player's objective is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.
The human wants to outscore the dealer, despite not knowing the dealer's score.
The dealer plays by a simple rule: hit until the hand's score is greater than or equal to 17 ("stand on 17").
In this game there is no betting, no splitting, no doubling down
